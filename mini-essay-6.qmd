abstract: "This paper explores the intricate relationship between data, their contextual underpinnings, and the extent to which they can be allowed to \"speak for themselves\". Drawing from Jordan (2019), D'Ignazio and Klein (2020, chap. 6), Au (2020), and other seminal works, we critically examine the notion that data, in isolation, can offer unbiased truths. We argue that context not only shapes the collection, analysis, and interpretation of data but is indispensable for ethical and accurate data usage."

# Introduction

In the realm of data science and analytics, a frequently debated topic is the autonomy of data in narrative construction and decision-making. The phrase "letting the data speak for themselves" suggests an objective neutrality in data, seemingly free from human bias or contextual influence. However, this perspective overlooks the complex socio-political, historical, and ethical dimensions that underpin data collection and analysis. This paper delves into these dimensions, leveraging insights from Jordan [@citejordan], who emphasizes the unfulfilled promises of AI and big data, D'Ignazio and Klein [@citedatafeminism], who argue for the incorporation of feminist principles in data analysis to unveil and challenge power imbalances, and Au [@citerandyau], who highlights the potential distortions in educational data analysis.

# Discussion

## Data Neutrality Myth

Data are often perceived as raw, objective facts waiting to be harnessed for insights. However, as Jordan [@citejordan] illustrates, the current AI and big data revolution has not lived up to its transformative promises, partly due to the overlooked biases and limitations inherent in data collection and analysis processes.

## Contextual Imperatives 

D'Ignazio and Klein [@citedatafeminism] introduce the concept of "Data Feminism", advocating for a critical examination of data practices through a feminist lens. They argue that data are never context-free and that ignoring the socio-political context in which data are embedded can perpetuate existing inequalities and power dynamics.

## Practical Implications in Education

Au [@citerandyau] provides a compelling case study in the field of education, where data-driven policies and practices often fail to account for the nuanced realities of educational inequities. The lack of contextual consideration can lead to misguided interventions that do not address the root causes of disparities.

# Acknowledgements

I acknowledge Sakhil for his insightful feedback.

# Conclusion

The assertion that data can independently convey truths is a simplification that ignores the intricate layers of context that inform data collection, interpretation, and application. Recognizing and integrating these layers is crucial for responsible and effective data use. This paper advocates for a more nuanced approach to data analysis, one that acknowledges the inherent biases and power structures that shape data and insists on the importance of context in deriving meaningful insights.
